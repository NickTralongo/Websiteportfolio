      <h3>My Discourse</h3>
      <p>A discourse is something defined by a man named James Paul Gee, that highlights five key parts. These ideas are saying, doing, believing, being, and valuing. To be able to be apart of a discourse community you have to follow these ground rules. These ideas are basic guidelines to help you in seeing the bigger picture and where you would fit or what you want to be a part of. Gee also describes two branches off of his definition of discourses, primary discourses and secondary discourses. Primary discourses are typically directed toward your home and family and can be explained as a foundation, or just something you are simply a part of. Secondary discourses are different in the fact that they are influenced or learned by social interaction and institutions. My discourse is baseball and it was something that was introduced to me by my family. According to Swales, not all discourses that claim to be discourses actually are. Swales says that if your discourse does not meet all of the six points it is not a discourse. Baseball has been my life since I was a kid and is my discourse because it meets the necessities to Gee and Swales ideals of what a discourse is.</p>
      <p>Swales’ first characteristic describes that to be able to be considered a discourse community, they must show that there are common public goals trying to be achieved by the entire group. Baseball fits this category in every way starting first with winning the championship. Every guy/girl wants to have that feeling where they get to hold that shiny trophy and look at their glimmering reflection. I mean who doesn’t want to win a trophy saying that you beat everyone else. Everyone wants that feeling and I think that is a goal that every baseball team has because getting that trophy after winning the championship is a reflection of the team's hard work and effort into something that we can be proud of for the rest of our lives. The second most important goal would be the best player that you could possibility be. That of course always starts with putting enough effort in to prove that you can be a great contribution to your team. Every player wants to be the best player, but most importantly every player wants to prove that they are valuable to their team and always puts themselves out for the team first. That is important when it comes to a team goal in being able to have a community where everyone puts themselves to the team first before just focusing on how they can be a better player for himself. The third most important goal to have would be doing everything the professionals are spitting, chewing gum and most importantly looking good. There isn't a baseball player that I know that doesn’t spit or have a giant ball of gum in their mouth. Spitting is almost like a tradition, you just do it and gum just creates the best biggest bubble competitions ever. But we can't forget that most important part of this goal, you have to look cool. Everything from your cleats and sock design all the way up to your custom team hat you want anything that makes you look good for the girls and intimidating at the same time. Baseball is a perfect qualification for Swales’ first characteristic and shows how common goals within my team are established.</p>
      <p>Swales’ second characteristic provides reasoning on intercommunication that is meant to connect the members of the discourse community. A great way to communicate is to have team meetings and talk about statistics about our favorite major league baseball teams or see what's going on with each other lately because that actually keeps us closer to each other. Another way of bonding like that is through having game nights with the athletes and players to talk and eat food. It's always best to get to know your teammates because then chemistry is created and we all get along better and therefore play together better. intercommunication by talking at a baseball game or going to a baseball with some teammates or the whole team can make for a fun experience and learning experience for us all by watching the pros we can relate and or see what we have to improve to get better. Most intercommunication happens on the field. We all talk to each other in baseball slang to motivate each other to achieve our goal as a discourse. For instance we will yell at each other “atta boy” which another words is good job or keep doing what you are doing or another is while playing defence to calm the pitcher down we'll yell “roll me one” basically telling the pitcher that we got you and you can trust us behind you if you are to throw a strike and the batter hits a ground ball. Things like this is what keep a team structured and in a sense a team.</p>
      <p>Swales’ third characteristic is all about information given and then the discourse group is then able to give feedback. An information source that I use to communicate in my discourse would be television. I watch television all the time and there is always commercials. A lot of the commercials are about baseball events or buying tickets or about some new apparel and I usually would tell my teammates and friends about these new products or going to a baseball game with a sweet deal. Another thing that I communicate would be magazines because I have a lot of subscriptions so I get a lot of baseball magazines in the mail about statistics on players and new equipment. I would inform my coach about new bats and batting gloves and helmets so that with our fundraising money we would be able to get those cool new utilities. The third way I communicate is by the sports radio. I would usually listen to the dodgers playing while I am in the car or if I am just sitting with my teammates and we are just hanging out. These are the three major ways that I inform my teammates on information on our discourse.</p>
      <p>Swales’ fourth characteristic describes how a discourse needs to have one or more genres in order to communicate with its members. Baseball can be separated into three specific yet different in their own way categories. The first would be little league. Everyone defines this as the beginners league or the organization you participated in when you were a little kid and first started playing baseball. I played little league ever since I could remember and could be eligible to play baseball. The moments I had as a little kid on the playing field will never be forgotten. The second would be the highschool level, which for the most part is where I developed my skills the most and became a competitive player. High School was a blast making all new and different friends with different backgrounds was new and very exciting. Even though my coach was horrible I still managed to make the best of my four years and have a blast thanks to my friends and love for baseball. The Third part would be college. So far college has been great I have met a lot of friends and still keep baseball a part of me. College is the next level after high school for playing baseball and then it is the pros. I don't plan on becoming a professional baseball player but I do plan on being the best player I can be and most importantly making sure that I have a lot of fun. According to Swales, these are three very key ideas on genres and a good example of showing the levels of baseball all the way from little league to college or the pros.</p>

According to Swales, these are three very key ideas on genres and a good example of showing the levels of baseball all the way from little league to college or the pros.</p>
    <p>Swales fifth characteristic describes how discourse communities acquire a specific lexis. Lexis meaning certain talk or sayings that may not pertain to the english language and could be fake that are used commonly in the discourse that help in forming that discourse. As many know baseball has a ton of lexis and many many many different ways it is used throughout the discourse. There are many different kinds of variables that represent things in baseball, one would be on base percentage or (OBP). This unit is not used in anything else and puts itself uniquely into a category for just baseball. A player's on base percentage (OBP) calculates the average of a player that gets a hit one out of every ten hits. This shows how hard getting a hit is in baseball if most players only have a .300 on base percentage of which is actually really good. Another unique lexis would be balls and strikes. Balls are used only in baseball and are defined by the pitcher (the person who throws the baseball) throwing the ball in a specific area defined by the umpire. If the pitcher throws the ball outside of this area it is defined as a ball. If a player is to receive 4 balls their turn at bat is over and they get to walk to first base. Strikes on the other hand are a totally different method of calculation. Strikes are when the pitcher throws the ball in the defined area for that umpire. If the player is to receive 3 strikes then they are out. The third lexis would be innings and outs. Outs is when the defending team (the one on the field) makes a play buy throwing the ball to the designated base that the player is running to in order from first base, second base, third base, and then home plate. If the defending team obtains three outs it is the end of the inning and the teams switch sides. Innings are the conclusion point of a round basically. Once one team has gotten three outs and then the next team has gotten three outs that is the end of the first inning. This accurately describes how lexis plays a role in my discourse of baseball.</p>
    <p>Swales’ sixth and last point states that a discourse community must have a threshold level of members with a suitable degree of relevant content and discoursal expertise. Basically that a discourse communities members are not all on the same level of expertise. Some members are experts at the game and others are novice. As people will start to move up in the community and leave, others will move up and replace them. In baseball this is a huge thing for best player at baseball is constantly changing and players retire. My discourse of baseball requires me to first have experience of the game. I have to play the game well and be well organized with my skills to be successful. Second you need to have knowledge of the game. I have to use my brain and think all the time about what is the smartest play and how to react to it. And the third thing Is I have to be physically capable of keeping up. To make sure that others don’t pass me I have to make sure that I am always working out and keeping up in the best of shape so that I don’t fall behind and fall way down the chart and can’t catch up.</p>
    <p>Throughout my life my coaches have helped me to become the player I am as well as my mentality and my friends. I have developed skills i know through determination and feel that it is necessary to have at least some talent to be good at baseball. Baseball isn't the sport for everyone and is definitely one of the hardest ones out there so I give it and myself a lot of credit. I am very proud of myself for how far that I have gotten and my parents couldn’t be more proud of me. But i agree with Swales and everything that he has stated I completely agree with.</p>
    <p>In conclusion I love baseball with a passion and I am glad to say that it is my discourse and these are all of the most important reasons to what a discourse is.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Project one I thought was a great intro to starting off the class. Introducing Gee’s idea and description of what a discourse is really was helpful in the start to developing a good structured essay. As well as Swales six points on what a discourse require also really helped me to understand what a discourse is because I didn’t understand it that much only learning about Gee’s view on what a discourse is. Even though I may have not been prepared for it and hated it at the beginning, I am really really thankful in the long run for learning about these tho because they helped me so much. If it were not for project one I don’t think that I would be as improved in structuring my essays as I am now. So, project one all in all even though it may have been painful at the beginning, it really ended up paying off and becoming a huge help.</p>
