    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>Overall HCOM-211 has been the best English class that I have ever taken. I have learned so much and have come so far in how to write and compose my essays. Professor Medina-Lopez is the best English teacher that I have ever had. She taught me so much and I am so thankful that she has been my teacher for this semester. She was funny and cool always was super helpful and was easy to understand. Every Class has its ups and downs but for this class I really didn’t have any. I really hope that I can have her as a professor again because she made learning easy and very fun. The three projects in this class are part of a bigger picture that was almost like one big project. Every project in some way was connected which I really liked. All of the projects together really felt like it was a process in making me become a better writer and has significantly made my structure and writing better which I am very thankful for.
Project one I thought was a great intro to starting off the class. Introducing Gee’s idea and description of what a discourse is really was helpful in the start to developing a good structured essay. As well as Swales six points on what a discourse require also really helped me to understand what a discourse is because I didn’t understand it that much only learning about Gee’s view on what a discourse is. Even though I may have not been prepared for it and hated it at the beginning, I am really really thankful in the long run for learning about these tho because they helped me so much. If it were not for project one I don’t think that I would be as improved in structuring my essays as I am now. So, project one all in all even though it may have been painful at the beginning, it really ended up paying off and becoming a huge help.
Project two was really enjoyable because in high school it was rare when we got to be able to write about something that we got to choose. So being able to choose what I did my essay on was a huge plus right from the beginning. Choosing something controversial in today’s society as the main topic for the essay was a little hard at first but after thinking about it for a little while I decided to do my topic on racism and whether or not it is still a problem today. Going into the project I was really excited but after researching for a little bit I realized that I much rather had done the project on cars. Cars I think would have been a lot more enjoyable because I have such a big interest in them as well as making the work easy because I know so much about them. But, I am still glad that I challenged myself and was able to do my project successfully. Project two really helped me in writing resource papers because I never really wrote any in high school. So even though I would have much rather done the project on a different subject it was still fun and I really enjoyed it. I really know a lot more about how to write research papers and I know a lot more about racism in society today.
Project three was a continuation from project two involving the same subject. Again nice to be able to choose our own topic. Project three was still a research paper but it was a persuasive research paper which I have never done before. I was pretty excited to see how this essay would work because I have never done something like this before. It was cool writing this essay because it really felt like I was a expert on racism after realizing that the third essay was all about putting what I learned through my research in project two into project three and taking a side. This was like the last step almost in learning how to compose a good essay and that is what this class helped me to do this project opened my eyes to a problem that I had come up with and isn’t really being taken care of. I thought that was really cool and driving to make me become a better writer. So, if it were not for project three I don’t think that I would be as knowledgeable of how to structure an essay as I am today.
Not only were the projects fun and helpful but the socratic seminars were as well. The first socratic seminar was for the book A Place to Stand. I thought that this book was very inspirational to me and really surprised me for being a real story that a person can go from nothing to something. The strength that Jimmy Santiago Baca had throughout his life was unimaginable and if I were in his position I would have no idea what to do. Growing up with almost nothing and dropping out high school not caring about anything in life, really sounded like it was impossible for him to get his life turned around. Becoming a drug dealer and going to jail for an attempt at murder as well as getting caught with drugs. In jail the only thing that was able to keep him sane was writing and he learned how to write in jail all on his own. After being in jail for a long time he continued a carrier of being a writer and wrote a book about his life story. Nothing is more crazy than this man's life and frankly I haven’t heard of a story as bad as this where the person lived to tell the story. I thought that the book was very inspirational and sort of put that image in my head that really if you set your mind to it you can do it. I know that may sound cheesy but it’s true. Being able to talk to my classmates about it was cool. Everyone seemed to have their own perspective and interesting viewpoint about the message that they got from the book. What I really thought was cool though was that everyone participated in the socratic seminars it wasn’t just the same three people because in high school you had fish bowls similar to the socratic seminars that we had but they were never good or helpful at all because it would always be the same three people in the class and everyone else would just sit there on their phone. So i'm glad that these were a lot more engaging because I really enjoyed them and I actually saw some perspectives that I never would have ever seen before if it weren’t for people being engaged. The second socratic seminar that we had was very interesting in the fact that we talked about the subjects that we choose to do our essay on in project two. This socratic seminar went longer than everyone expected it to. Everyone spoke on everyone's topic and some of them got very intense often leading into other subjects but we didn't seem to stop. I liked how it turned into a debate sort of and people got defencive and stood by what they thought was right. Everyone participating really helped to get everything going and I am glad that we were able to because like I said about the first socratic seminar I didn’t have that kind of involved conversation with the class in high school it was always the same three people talking. But overall both socratic seminars were very helpful and i'm glad we had them because those days were really fun. All I have left to say is thank you so much for being my professor and all of the things you have taught me in such a short time. Hopefully I will have you in the future thanks again.</p>
