    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>My research question is:
Is racial discrimination still shown in athletics? Is it surpassed by Americans or is it recognized?
My answer to this question is (claim):
	The social displays of racism are still apparent in athletics and are constantly overlooked</p>
<p>The reasons why I believe this is the correct answer are:
1) As a sports player myself, all my life I have witnessed countless acts of racism
2) Yes players get competitive and into the game, but there is a point where a line needs to be drawn
3) It can become a bad influence on children who look up to professional players
4) It happens all of the time and businesses take care of them minimally or not at all</p>
<p>How does this issue affect a discourse community you are a part of?
For me being in the baseball discourse, I can see how racism affects players in sports and sometimes how it can affect the game as well.</p>
<p>Combine the answers (claim + reasons) to the above questions into a clear, focused, arguable thesis. Write it here:
The displays of racism in athletics are still apparent and should be scrutinized because of the influence professional players have on kids, the unclear guidelines on what is right and wrong, and the exposure of media and press.</p>
<h4>Reason 1: Influence professional players have on kids</h4>
<p>Main supporting point one: Professional players are set as role models whether they like it or not.
	How does this support?: Kids want to be like the pros in every aspect and can obtain violent and racist behavior.

<h4>Counter arguments</h4>
<p>Q: If you were to not allow fans to say those things on twitter or facebook it would be limiting freedom of speech. A: There is a difference between limiting freedom of speech and human decency. People wouldn’t be limited they should just be aware and because they are choosing to say those things makes it a huge problem that people need to be aware of.
	Q:The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” allowing people to be notified of racist acts that sports players have done would only influence people and children more about racism.  A: Well if people are not informed about what is happening in our world today then they are just being lied to. People need to be informed about the things that are going on and are bad because that is what the news is for not to hide it from society and pretend like it never happened. For instance Bob Cook explains “Whenever there is an accusation of racist behavior leveled toward a school or youth team -- or much more often, its supporters -- the response of the defending party is to deny it, or to be shocked and make clear it doesn't represent the wider community” he is elaborating on the fact that nobody wants to admit they are at fault or did something wrong and tend to push it away from themselves. Just like History, if we are not reminded of the mistakes that we have made in the past they will continue to happen and those hiding it from the public will continue to hide it.</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>Farrington et al., describes my favorite and most inspirational quote "One could suggest that if 'race' discourse is upheld in everyday language, the problematic ideology of racial difference will continue to live on. What we must remember is that 'racial' differences are social inventions, not natural or scientific constructions. Thus, 'races do not exist outside representation but are formed in and by it in a process of social and political struggle'(Barker 1999, p61)."</p>

    <h3>Racism in Sports</h3>
    <p>After doing my research on racism on the sides of both those who feel racial discrimination is still a problem and those who do not believe racial discrimination is currently an issue. I can say that I personally feel as though racism is a very big issue still and affects me directly. Being a part of the sports discourse, it made me realize that racism is still shown in athletics. But, going even deeper into that question, I wondered if Americans recognize the racial discrimination or if they just surpass it. These questions came to my attention because myself being a kid who has participated in sports my entire life, has witnessed countless numbers of times where kids have been racist all throughout my years of playing ball. From when I was little I saw kids calling other kids names and even saying things that a kid under ten shouldn’t be saying all while playing a friendly activity. Even until the age I am now, I remember my senior year of high school my friend and the opposing team's player, got into a fight over a stupid play and the player called my friend the n-word. The displays of racism in athletics are still apparent and should be scrutinized because of the influence professional players have on kids, the unclear guidelines on what is right and wrong, and the exposure of media and press.</p>
    <p>A key factor that is overlooked is the amount of influence that professional players have on kids. Professional players are set as role models whether they like it or not. Every little kid has that one favorite sports player, and every kid wants to be like their favorite sports player. Kids can get so attached to a player that they will repeat things that they do because they want to be like them in every aspect. Keaton Dadigan states in his article that according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, “74 percent of kids say that it is common for a professional athlete to yell at a referee; 62 percent say that trash talking opponents is the norm; and 46 percent say it’s not uncommon for athletes to take cheap shots at opponents.” The fact that kids today think that these things are okay is horrible and affects everyone around them. When kids think that it is okay to say or act like this, means that when kids see a professional player make a racist action a large percentage will think that it is okay. Lapchick brings up another valid point that “There seems to be a broad agreement that acts of racism in the United States are increasing at an alarming rate. The same was true in sport in 2016, where such acts tripled from 11 in 2015 to 31 in 2016.” according to research and analysis from the University of Central Florida's Institute for Diversity and Ethics and Sport. This means that not only is the acts of racism increasing but the amount has tripled in only a year from 2015 to 2016. Many people have said that racism is dying down and we are getting better than we ever were. Well, the numbers keep going up so there is no possible way that it could be getting any better and therefore kids are being exposed to racist acts more than they were before. A very important point that Lapchick brings up is “All over the world, individuals witnessed 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick take a knee during the national anthem. His action created a great deal of controversy nationwide.” This great example of how kids can see what is happening in the world today and understand it a lot easier because of their role model. A huge movement is recognized by young kids who saw Colin Kaepernick kneel during the national anthem as a peaceful protest to state that he feels suppressed in this country and will not support something that is suppressing someone because of the color of their skin. His act became a trend and soon other professional athletes started to kneel too and colleges and high schools and even little kids.</p>
    <p>Parents play a huge role in the effect that they have on their children when it comes to sports. Often times parents feel the need to step in and “give advice” or tell them what to do or how to do it. But, it is important to know in Rose Erickson’s article “Parents greatly affect their children’s behavior. Children are like sponges--they model everything a parent does and incorporate what they see into their own lives. It is important that parents set the right examples for their children. Negative examples can be detrimental to a child’s development and can lead to bad behavior.” Meaning that parents verbal actions can affect their child in how they react or act to things. If crude language is used around the house and for instance, the parents are yelling some racist terms. The child can pick up on those things because again as Erickson states “Children are like sponges” and are easily influenced by their parents. Another great point is that “Dysfunctional families breed dysfunctional children. Children often repeat this behavior in their future relationships.” Erickson explains the importance of family and how being around one another makes everyone sort of absorb everyone else's traits. For instance, parents who are irresponsible and don’t talk respond or care about most things will all reflect on the child and they will become irresponsible and careless. Then growing up with these traits they then start to spread on to others whether it be bullying or just bad behavior and badly influence peers almost like a virus. “If a parent reacts negatively, a child will learn to react negatively as well. In addition, negative reactions to stress, such as yelling and lashing out, can scare a child.” Erickson states in her article about the handling of stress. How the mindset of reacting with stress can influence a child and reveal a child to racist trends by taking out their stress in ways that are unacceptable.</p>
    <p>Violent children are very easily influenced and enjoy it so they are quite capable of repeating actions made by their favorite sports player. Some sports can get very violent and disturbing like hockey for instance. According to Carrie Cross’ article “But this protective padding and gear may not be enough to protect your son or daughter from the checks along the boards, the tussles on the ice and the scuffles around the net. As your child gets older and graduates into pee wee and bantam leagues, this violence on the ice can translate into injuries.” going into the fact that children exposed to sports like hockey for instance are encouraged to act with violence and as they grow up that violence causes a lot of injured players. But a huge part of that is watching their favorite players on tv. When a kid sees a hockey player that they love slam a guy and trash talk him, they want to do it as well if that’s what it takes to be a pro. But there are times when things are wrong and right and children reciprocating the actions of a professional can put all these kids at harm.</p>

    <p>Parents play a huge role in the effect that they have on their children when it comes to sports. Often times parents feel the need to step in and “give advice” or tell them what to do or how to do it. But, it is important to know in Rose Erickson’s article “Parents greatly affect their children’s behavior. Children are like sponges--they model everything a parent does and incorporate what they see into their own lives. It is important that parents set the right examples for their children.

    <p>Violent children are very easily influenced and enjoy it so they are quite capable of repeating actions made by their favorite sports player. Some sports can get very violent and disturbing like hockey for instance. According to Carrie Cross’ article “But this protective padding and gear may not be enough to protect your son or daughter from the checks along the boards, the tussles on the ice and the scuffles around the net. As your child gets older and graduates into pee wee and bantam leagues, this violence on the ice can translate into injuries.” going into the fact that children exposed to sports like hockey for instance are encouraged to act with violence and as they grow up that violence causes a lot of injured players. But a huge part of that is watching their favorite players on tv. When a kid sees a hockey player that they love slam a guy and trash talk him, they want to do it as well if that’s what it takes to be a pro. But there are times when things are wrong and right and children reciprocating the actions of a professional can put all these kids at harm. Keaton Dadigan brings up a very important point in his article about parents and their children saying “What do you want your kid, who’s passionate about sports, to grow up to be? Do you want them to become an athlete that works hard to provide for their family and participate in charity work for the community? Or a player that only cares about making money, living the high life and getting endorsement deals?” this statement reveals that yes of course every parent wants the best for their child and a role model with good intentions, but this opens your eyes and makes you see that children are exposed to violence if not directed properly. Thus relating back to the topic of parents in that children need guidance but do not receive or are unable to receive the right guidance. Most of these athletes don’t even know how much they influence people. According to Dadigan’s article, he justifies “Believe it or not, a survey released just before the Super Bowl suggests that 64 percent of Americans think professional athletes have more influence in society than pastors.” meaning that more than 50% of the people in our country believe that professional players influence people more than the pastors whose main intention is to influence people. Imagine then the effect that professional players have on these kids who look up to these players more than adults. Violent acts of racism are increasingly bound to happen. So many may not know how important of a role that athletes play in kids lives but it is most likely a lot more than you thought before.</p>
    <h4>Reason 2: Unclear guidelines on what is right and wrong</h4>
    <p>When we think of the two terms right and wrong together, we generally think of guidelines or a rule system. As Amanda Williams explains in her article, “Rules provide an agreement of understanding to competition. In sports, rules define what is allowed or not allowed to occur during situations on and off the court.” meaning that the rules are the guidelines which players abide by based upon wrong and right. Sports players tend to break these rules or guidelines all of the time. The part of the quote stated in William’s article, “on and off the court” is what players don’t realize or think about, but their attitude should be represented off the field as it is off the field. There has been many cases of professional players crashing cars and getting drunk and reckless off the field and they are representing their team. So, when something bad happens everyone on the team gets penalized for it. The same has happened with racist actions not only in professional players but in all players as well. Going into that, Williams also describes that, “The rules of a game apply to players, coaches and officials, and vary among different sports and age groups.” so really there is nobody who is really excluded from the rules. For instance for when all those coaches that say, “If you have problem let me handle it” no, it is still the coaches responsibility to follow the rules, meaning that it would be the same if the player said it. Tracy L. Ziemer states in his article that, “The sports associations and the media have also effectively deemed that these athletes are 24/7 role models or moral exemplars for all that they do. Both pertain to all behaviour - be it on or off the field, connected or unconnected to their sport.” reiterates Williams statement of behavior shown on and off the field as well as describing that athletes are role models all of the time and everything that they do are examples for everyone else. For example professional baseball players are known for chewing tobacco and kids look up to these players and they chew tobacco as well, which agreeably is a bad thing to do. I have witnessed this with my own eyes players I know so what is to say about all of the misguided racist acts that players make like gestures or verbal attacks.</p>
    <p>Fans are a big part of not knowing what is the right thing to do is and the wrong thing to do is. Fans are one of the biggest parts of athletics and without them players and coaches would never get payed. But fans don’t think that they have to abide by the same rules that players have to. From public actions, to tweets online, fans say inappropriate or uncalled for things that are racist and rude but nothing is done about them. In Bob Cook’s article he quotes tweets from high school students, “Among the tweets: "All hail white power. #Hitler is MyDad" and "Tonight was probably one of the most racist nights of my life. I heard so many slurs and expressions. I also said a few things...".” just shows some these actions that these kids say towards other people at a basketball game and how they just obtain it from their peers. So from one person chanting something racist turns into a group, then a crowd, and can eventually become a whole stadium. A great example that Jennifer Ellison-Brown describes in her article is “In 2012, the Serbian FA were fined when their fans made monkey noises directed at a black player in an Under-21 match against England.” which is completely uncalled for and disrespectful to everyone that someone should be mocked for the way that they look. Another example from Richard Lapchick’s article, “A Serena Williams fan  dressed up in blackface at the Australian Open. The act raised questions of racism and the acceptability of blackface in Australia.” shows that people don’t even know if it is okay they are questioning it. These are only two examples and there are hundreds of more, but the idea is that fans are a part of sports and are huge contributors to the racial tension.</p>
    <p>Stereotypes are also one of the biggest tributes that fans create based upon commonalities or made up information. Nadra Nittle describes that “stereotypes are characteristics imposed upon groups of people because of their race, nationality, and sexual orientation, among others.” meaning how others generalize a group of people based their race, sex, or religion. There are good and bad stereotypes but most of them have bad connotations. Nittle later describes how stereotypes of people from one location differ from those in another even though they are the same race. So, because of those outcomes we can agree when Nittle says “stereotypes make little sense and aren’t useful tools by which to judge others.” Justin Block and Jose Martinez elaborate on in their article about the biggest stereotypes in sports history. For example a stereotype that really stood out to me because of my discourse, that Block and Martinez talk about, is “Young black American athletes don't like baseball.” meaning that players of African American decent do not like baseball. This has never in fact been true and coming from a personal view I can say that there are plenty of African American people who love baseball and I have played with. The problem isn’t with the people but it is more of a financial problem, like Block and Martinez say “you need a bat, ball, glove and an open field just to play baseball.” which can be expensive and most people cannot afford the necessary utilities. These negative downsets and words only hurt people and make them not want to play and there are stereotypes in every single sport. NASCAR is a great example that Block and Martinez elaborate on about “Only rednecks watch NASCAR.” basically stating that only white people watch NASCAR. Well as a matter of fact, Block and Martinez bring up that “Current driver Juan Pablo Montoya is a Colombian who actually defected from Formula One, bringing Latin American interest to the fold.” as well as “Magic Johnson is NASCAR's co-chairman of its Executive Steering Committee for Diversity and former NBA player Brad Daughtery grew up a fan of the sport and has been a NASCAR analyst for awhile now.” are three examples showing that just because coincidentally a large amount of people are associated with a sport necessarily means that that sport only contains a particular race. Bad viewpoints such as stereotypes are horrible for society and can promote racism even if those are not intending to. People becoming educated on what is right and wrong is extremely important and is a bigger problem than most think.</p>
    <h4>Reason 3: Exposure of media and press</h4>
    <p>The media and press play the biggest role when it comes to racism in athletics. From the newspaper to the internet, people rely and use these sources as a reliable source for information. The press is a key part of every single community in which they can obtain info on the current events going on in their neighborhood as well as big cities and and almost everywhere in the nation. The newspaper was the first to be the wide supplier of sports news around the country with its easy access and reliability. The newspaper was endless and the big problem with it is whether or not it is reliable. In Neil Farringon’s et al. book, they talk about the newspaper and its limits later saying, "Of course newspapers have every right to report on events in a robust and partisan fashion; indeed, the Code of practice protects that right. But that right must be balanced by responsibility." concluding that yeah you can say whatever you want in the newspaper but those who publish should be responsible enough and careful enough to make sure that there is no abuse of that right. These newspaper journalists have more power than you would expect and can leak fake news that can be harmful or discriminatory toward a certain group. Farrington et al. goes deeper into this subject stating, "sports reporting has the power and ability to shape people's opinions on contentious issues such as 'race', racism, ethnicity, nationalism and belonging." meaning that these journalists could even persuade people to believe something and make them become biased toward something. These journalists control everything that goes into the newspaper and they control everything that the reader sees. But as the years have gone on the newspaper has started to fade away and new technologies arose and also became sources that people rely on. Farrington et al. explains "Sports journalism has received relatively little academic attention to date." by which for example television has surpassed the newspaper allowing for even more exposure of racist acts in sports today.</p>
    <p>Television has evolved from the newspaper and the radio allowing for a even more entertaining and convenient access to see and hear sports. Farrington et al. describes in their book about the "Satellite television, which has bought rights to major sporting events and promoted them vigorously as one of the most effective ways of selling subscriptions to its services." which means that the amount of people that buy and watch television in their home has become the biggest factor in the promotion of selling subscriptions. The giant increase in people year after year that watch television keep adding up so all of those people who couldn’t go to the baseball game in Los Angeles because they live in Florida can be a part of a subscription and watch it at home. This would allow people at home to be able to witness inappropriate behavior or violence without having to actually be there. Then describing how it affects everyone Farrington et al. states that "Rather than providing further competition for sports journalism, television has helped to create a culture in which sport, and sports stars as both athletes and celebrities, increasingly take centre stage." making sports players celebrities and exposing everything they do with reports and questions rather than having more competition. This pulls players more away from them actually being sports players and more of media stars. They are watched 24/7 and almost to a point where they have no privacy at all. This then exposes players to the public more and into their personal lives often being led down the wrong path and releasing everything about them if they make any mistake. Those mistakes often are associated with something violent or racial can ruin both the players life and the fan bases life. Farrington et al. then talks about how "The influx of money into sport (particularly football) in the form of broadcasting rights has created a lucrative feeding ground on which sports stars, sports journalism and broadcasters can all grow fat together." meaning all these players get crazy money and income because of the television exposure. Players then tend to buy stupid things and give off bad impressions about themselves and who they are to the public.</p>
    <p>The internet has been the furthest advancement into today's society allowing people to be able to message over the web watch videos and research topics. The internet is one of the biggest and easiest ways people can gain information and communicate through worldwide. Through internet communication people can post and chat with others not only nearby but around the world. Tom Malone reiterates in his article that “Sports news coverage found new facets of distribution with online media. From the casual blogger to legitimate corporate websites, anyone with an Internet connection can participate in the discussion through spatialization.” meaning that internet is easily accessible and anyone can participate if they wanted to in conversation which can of course lead to poor choices and the harmful effects of race sports can have on varying opinions. One way people communicate on the internet is through memes. Lapchick explains in his article about “One meme compared Goodes to Harambe the gorilla. The first of many memes had been liked on Facebook by over 5,500 people, and most of the comments were highly racist.” just shows the way people are and respond to things are no different then how they are in sports. Most people have no restrictions or borders on what they say especially when they can say something online anonymously so nobody really knows who said it. Cases of things like this on the internet happen all of the time and nothing is done about it. Topics on sports players and simply the sports themselves are mocked or stereotyped by people because they think that it is funny or that they can get a kick out of it when it is nothing to joke about. Farrington et al. later summarizes that "Across the globe, racism manifests itself in various ways that ensure that people are victimized on the basis of some negative biological and/or cultural trait which they are suppose to process." so in meaning that people are almost deceased in a way that makes it so that others are victimized due to a physical or cultural traits.</p>
    <h4>Counter Arguments</h4>
    <p>Some people may say that “If you were to not allow fans to say those things on twitter or facebook it would be limiting freedom of speech.” Yes, that would be limiting freedom of speech but there is a difference between limiting freedom of speech and human decency. People wouldn’t be limited they should just be aware and because they are choosing to say those things makes it a huge problem that people need to be aware of. Another thing that people might argue is that “The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” allowing people to be notified of racist acts that sports players have done would only influence people and children more about racism.” Well if people are not informed about what is happening in our world today then they are just being lied to. People need to be informed about the things that are going on and are bad because that is what the news is for not to hide it from society and pretend like it never happened. For instance Bob Cook explains “Whenever there is an accusation of racist behavior leveled toward a school or youth team -- or much more often, its supporters -- the response of the defending party is to deny it, or to be shocked and make clear it doesn't represent the wider community” he is elaborating on the fact that nobody wants to admit they are at fault or did something wrong and tend to push it away from themselves. Just like History, if we are not reminded of the mistakes that we have made in the past they will continue to happen and those hiding it from the public will continue to hide it.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Even though people may think that racism is not a problem in sports or it is taken care of, I have done my research and proven why racism is still a problem in sports today. I am able to relate to this topic with being a part of the sports discourse and understand, both witnessing and experiencing racism in sports. Through what I have argued in my essay I can prove and say that the displays of racism in athletics are still apparent and should be scrutinized because of the influence professional players have on kids, the unclear guidelines on what is right and wrong, and the exposure of media and press. Farrington et al., describes my favorite and most inspirational quote that I found during my research, "One could suggest that if 'race' discourse is upheld in everyday language, the problematic ideology of racial difference will continue to live on. What we must remember is that 'racial' differences are social inventions, not natural or scientific constructions. Thus, 'races do not exist outside representation but are formed in and by it in a process of social and political struggle'(Barker 1999, p61)."</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Project three was a continuation from project two involving the same subject. Again nice to be able to choose our own topic. Project three was still a research paper but it was a persuasive research paper which I have never done before. I was pretty excited to see how this essay would work because I have never done something like this before. It was cool writing this essay because it really felt like I was a expert on racism after realizing that the third essay was all about putting what I learned through my research in project two into project three and taking a side. This was like the last step almost in learning how to compose a good essay and that is what this class helped me to do this project opened my eyes to a problem that I had come up with and isn’t really being taken care of. I thought that was really cool and driving to make me become a better writer. So, if it were not for project three I don’t think that I would be as knowledgeable of how to structure an essay as I am today.</p>
