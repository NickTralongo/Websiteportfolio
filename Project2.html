    <h3>Racism</h3>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Racism has increasingly been a controversial topic in today's society. I have witnessed racism and have seen it to be very prevalent sometimes, while others it doesn’t feel like it exists at all. Racism is an important factor in my life and I feel as though it should be just as valuable in everyone else's lives. I am a white male that never went through any type of oppression or discrimination, but, I have researched, talked about, and witnessed many racist things and can say that I understand that there are a lot of racial problems in the world that need to be dealt with. I don’t know if racism will ever go away or if it will stay forever. But, the major controversy in our country is whether racism is still a current factor in our society today. Racism is prejudice or discrimination against someone based on his/her race. Underlying this is the belief that different racial groups are superior to others. Racism can be witnessed through beliefs, policies, attitudes, and actions with every american viewing it differently. The research that I have done really illuminated 3 key themes that are central to the debate</p>
    <h4>Racism is still a problem - discrimination</h4>
    <p>According to Jenna Atkinson’s article the black lives matter has been a huge issue recently. She explains her trip to Chicago and how she witnessed protesting like she had never seen before. Protesters would scold and scrutinize as well as push  the police officers who were ironically there to protect the protesters. Disturbing sights of parents telling their children to go and push the police and telling them their lives matter. Those on the other side would support the police and yell that all lives matter. But what Jenna gets to is that people are acting like animals and she never thought that someone would ever think to act like that. Jenna elaborates on what she sees by stating “But this was by far the realest this issue has been for me personally. The problem is real and the tension is only getting worse.”. She believes that people are corrupting themselves and none of these actions are resolving the big picture of the “black lives matter” movement. She explains that a lot needs to change and that what she saw was definitely not the answer. If anything it digs the hole even deeper. All in all respect is needed on both sides.</p>
    <p>Leah Donella explains through her research that the more racism is taught in schools the less racist people will be. Children often obtain being racist from their parents and accumulate those same kind of beliefs typically from their parents. The story explains both the girl and parents sides and shows how the parents believe that the race barrier is way to hard to overcome and the girl doesn’t believe that at all.</p>
    <p>William Wan states that people often assume that parents actively teaching their kids makes them become racist because the children tend to obtain similar characteristics from the parents. Yet, ”The truth is that unless parents actively teach kids not to be racists, they will be,” said Jennifer Richeson a Yale University social psychologist. Education is the key part in teaching students what racism is. Children can quickly acquire associations and base assumptions on what groups other kids are in. It is a basic part of our biology and is inevitable. Therefore people have the tendency to put these groups and categorize people socially. The only way to be able to change people's bias is to change culture. For what is acceptable and what is not you have to change.</p>
    <p>Nicki Lisa Cole’s article on the contrary also explains parts on the side of racism is still a problem. She explains “While calling someone a dumb blond might result in feelings of frustration, irritation, discomfort, or even anger for the person targeted by the insult, it's rare that there would be further negative implications.” in that she is trying to explain yea, people can be discriminated in other ways but not typically in ways that affect a person's access to rights and resources in society. The n-word was popularized in the mid-twentieth century that contained very disturbing meanings “like the idea that black people are savage, dangerous brutes prone to criminality; that they lack morals and are compulsively hyper-sexual; and that they are stupid and lazy.  The wide-sweeping and deeply detrimental implications of this term, and the prejudices it reflects and reproduces makes it vastly different from suggesting that blonds are dumb.”</p>
    <h4>Ignorance</h4>
    <p>In Nicki Lisa Cole’s article it is stated that “Nearly 40 percent of white Americans believe that the U.S. has made the changes necessary to give Black people equal rights with whites.” That is almost half of all of the white people in the united states that believe that blacks are equal to whites as well as another 8% of black Americans who agree. She explains how she spoke with a man who took the n-word as something that was unspeakable. He states that “using it is no different than calling someone a “dumb blond,” and that people need to “move on” from believing that race and racism are issues that deserve attention in today’s world.” The man explained that as a blond person of German descent, he had experienced pain in his life due to this form of prejudice aimed at blond people. Supporting the fact that some believe that whites and every other race are just as discriminated just in different ways.</p>
    <p>In Ken Belsons article describes how Donald Trump responded to the NFL when they decided to not make it mandatory to stand during the national anthem. Trump states that it is a completely disrespectful thing to do and disrespect to our country. It was made clear to players that there would be not penalties for players who kneeled during the national anthem. Trump wanted players fired that demonstrated these acts and the NFl would not go through with that because they said that “The league’s rule book never required players to stand for the anthem but says they must be on the sideline during the song and “should” stand for it.” so there was no reason to change it.</p>

Racism can be witnessed through beliefs, policies, attitudes, and actions with every american viewing it differently.

    <h4>Equality</h4>
    <p>Based off Pew Research Center, the division between races has been huge. Many blacks are skeptical whether or not there will be changes made or not for racial equality at the same time whites believing that changes have been made that give blacks equal rights. The Pew Research Center conducted a survey of 3,769 adults (including 1,799 whites, 1,004 blacks and 654 Hispanics) from Feb. 29-May 8, 2016. It showed the opinions from whites and blacks whether or not they think that the country will eventually make changes on racial equality. Based upon the chart 40% of whites believe that we will eventually make changes and blacks with 42% believing that our country will eventually make changes. On the other side whites that believe that the country will not make the changes is 11% and blacks at a whopping 43%. This explains the racial division between blacks and whites and want for social equality. Pew explains how this shows the broad and different perspectives between blacks and whites and the current state in America. Pew Research Center explains through their survey the division between the races and how both sides view equality and that both sides need to understand each other.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, we see the difference in races and the the difficulties many go through based on my research. I am really hoping that we as a community are able to fix everyone's problems but who knows what's next. Maybe we will reach equality and everyone will not have anything to worry about anymore or maybe the opposite and there will be even more problems in the future. But the idea that I believe hasn't been viewed upon is recognition of racism in sports. It is still happening and nobody seems to see that it is a problem. I would like to research more about the racism in sports and really see what is going on that the public isn't seeing that much of. But I really hope that everyone can get along and thrive in a community where people are understanding of other people.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Project two was really enjoyable because in high school it was rare when we got to be able to write about something that we got to choose. So being able to choose what I did my essay on was a huge plus right from the beginning. Choosing something controversial in today’s society as the main topic for the essay was a little hard at first but after thinking about it for a little while I decided to do my topic on racism and whether or not it is still a problem today. Going into the project I was really excited but after researching for a little bit I realized that I much rather had done the project on cars. Cars I think would have been a lot more enjoyable because I have such a big interest in them as well as making the work easy because I know so much about them. But, I am still glad that I challenged myself and was able to do my project successfully. Project two really helped me in writing resource papers because I never really wrote any in high school. So even though I would have much rather done the project on a different subject it was still fun and I really enjoyed it. I really know a lot more about how to write research papers and I know a lot more about racism in society today.</p>
